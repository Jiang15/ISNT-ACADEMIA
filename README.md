## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 2.1 Dataset

Our dataset has been generated by crawling is-academia. The crawling process has requested around 7 hours for a total of 6995 excel files. The crawler was hand-made, and it consisted of retrieving all the course identifiers (e.g., ww_x_MAT=2032682720) to construct our query. We have been able to crawl all the bachelor and master courses offered by EPFL from 2012 until now. A challenging task was to clean the data crawled and selected which ones we were interested in. Firstly, the files contained special characters (accents), reason why, we have chosen the Latin encoding. Moreover, data look like excel files, but they contain HTML code inside. To parse them, we have handled with table and inner tables. __However, after having parsed, the files are consistent with each other.(updated this part) and add part about pre-processing__

__ALSO BACHELOR?__ 

### 2.2 Problematic
#### 2.2.1 Target audience
We expect that the end-users who will mostly use our project will be mainly EPFL students and some few companies. Users can browse and look different courses taught by EPFL in the years from 2012 to 2020.

#### 2.2.2 Visualization purposes
- **#Enrollments per course**:  We want to focus mainly on the number of students enrolled in a course over the years to see if there are any correlations with some hot topics (e.g., Machine Learning is nowadays a hot topic, are the number of students enrolled in that course increased respect 2 years ago?).

- **Help the students to choose their courses**: We want to offer a tool to help students make more versed choices during the course registration by offering target visualizations. For example, if student "a" did courses "x", "y" and "z" like student "b" it is very likely that the two have similar interests. Then student "b" might see which other courses have been taken by student "a" to help him/her make an initial skimming of the subjects to follow in the semester. 

- **Find your perfect candidate**: Companies can filter applicants by looking for targeted students who have taken specific courses. At the moment, we would like to offer a visualization with anonymized data, but we could show the personal data of the student in case a company finds a match. __Do you like this idea? - Costanza__

- **General data representations**: We thought we would offer detailed information about the various courses when you hover over it. Some examples: a) we could show a graph to show the trend in the number of students over the years (as explained above); b) indicate the number of students who had re-taken an exam; c) the name of the professor who is teaching the course. Moreover, other general visualizations would be to show how many new classes have been added in the year "x" or how many have been removed.
