## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 2.1 Dataset
#### 2.1.1 Crawling
Our dataset has been generated by crawling [is-academia](https://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!gedpublicreports.htm?ww_i_reportmodel=66627699).
<p align="center">

</p>

The [crawling process](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-xiaozu/blob/master/src/crawling/Crawling-EPFL.ipynb) has requested around 7 hours for a total of 6995 excel files. The crawler was composed by a javascript code to retrieve all the course identifiers (e.g., ww_x_MAT=2032682720) to construct our query and a python part to download the files. We have been able to crawl all the bachelor and master courses offered by EPFL from 2012 until now. 

#### 2.1.2 Pre-processing
A challenging task was to clean the data crawled and to select the ones we are interested in. Firstly, the files contained special characters (accents), reason why, we have chosen the Latin encoding. Moreover, data is saved in excel files, which actually contain HTML code. We have decided to focus mainly on master courses since students are allowed to choose around 90 credits, and therefore it leads to a more customizable study plan. We have proceeded to clean the data that we have parsed, as shown in the notebook [Preprocessing](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-xiaozu/blob/master/src/data-analysis/preprocessing.ipynb), to create four tables, as shown in Sec. 2.1.3.

#### 2.1.3 Database generated
We have decided to store our data in 4 tables: Student, Enrollment, Course, Teaching.
- ``csv/courses.csv``: contains unique courses id, course name, teaching year.
- ``csv/student.csv``: constains unique student id, student name, student section.
- ``csv/teaching.csv``: contains course id and its corresponding professor.
- ``csv/enrollment.csv``: contains student id, course id, student semester.

### 2.2 Problematic
#### 2.2.1 Target audience
We expect that the end-users who will use our project will be mainly EPFL students but also companies may be interested in the tool. Users can browse and look at different courses taught by EPFL in the years from 2012 to 2020. 

#### 2.2.2 Visualization purposes
- **#Enrollments per course**:  We want to focus on the number of students enrolled in a course over the years to identify the courses which are becoming more popular (e.g., Machine Learning is nowadays a trendy topic, are the number of students enrolled in that course increased respect 2 years ago?).

- **Help the students to choose their courses**: We want to offer a tool to help students make more versed choices during the course registration by offering targeted visualizations. For example, if student "a" did courses "x", "y" and "z" like student "b" it is very likely that the two have similar interests. Then student "b" might see which other courses have been taken by student "a" to help him/her make an initial skimming of the subjects to follow in the semester. More advanced recommendation system algorithms can be experimented.

- **Find your perfect candidate**: Companies can filter applicants by looking to target students who have taken specific courses. 

- **General data representations**: Some examples: a) we could show a graph to show the trend in the number of students over the years (as explained above); b) indicate the number of students who had re-taken an exam. Moreover, other general visualizations would be to show how many new classes have been added in the year "x" or how many have been removed.

### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis
Our data analysis contains three parts. For each part, we build related tables by Pandas that include the figures for our objectives, and we show some examples in [Pre-analysis.ipynb](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-xiaozu/blob/master/src/data-analysis/Pre-analysis.ipynb).

- **Show the changes in the number of course enrollments over the years**, i.e., for each course; we compare the number of students in different years to show the popularity trend of each course. For instance, the "Image processing I" course is becoming increasing popular among students while fewer students are taking "Cryptography and Security" over recent years.

</p>

- **Compare the student major (section) composition of each course**. We get statistics of major intake in each course and then show the different compositions of different courses. For example, the majority of students in "Image processing I" are from Microengineering, while "Machine Learning" is mostly composed of Computer Science and Data Science students.

</p>

- **Analyze the similarity of courses through the student enrollments based on the hypothesis that the courses chosen by the same students have some commons**. We build the co-occurrence matrix of each course from the course lists taken by each student. We find it consistent with what we expected; for example, "Distributed algorithms" has a high co-occurrence matrix coefficient with "Concurrent algorithms", which is the same as "Data visualization" with "Applied data analysis".

</p>

- **Cluster the courses that are closer to each other**. We have treated the students as features (e.g., each course represented by a binary array), and then we have computed the correlation between the two courses on these arrays.

### 2.4 Related work
At the moment, we have not found any other related applications or websites. EPFL students choose courses based on the study plan offered online and keywords that are on the course description pages. At the moment, we have not found anything similar. However, the most similar idea could be found in work portals such as LinkedIn, where we can match people to jobs looking at their skills.


##### Some sketches of our future visualizations 
Show courses related to a selected one(s), since we a lot of courses we will ask to the user to filter which one they want to look (e.g., filter by section). Moreover to hightlight the connections (shown in pink in the Fig. below) the user can select multiple courses. When you hover on the title of a course you will see a card on the right showing some insights about it. We took the visualization idea from: [Exploring Comics project](https://github.com/ExploringComics/ExploringComics.github.io/blob/master/Comics_and_Diversity.pdf).

Show the top N courses for a section (e.g. IC) over the years.

Help a user to choose his/her next semester courses. You can insert your name as a student and it return the graphical representation of the courses that you have done with a suggestion of what you could do based on your interests.
