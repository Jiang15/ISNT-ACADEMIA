## Milestone 1 (Friday 3rd April, 5pm)

**10% of the final grade**

### 2.1 Dataset
#### 2.1.1 Crawling
Our dataset has been generated by crawling [is-academia](https://isa.epfl.ch/imoniteur_ISAP/!gedpublicreports.htm?ww_i_reportmodel=66627699).
<p align="center">

</p>

The [crawling process](https://github.com/com-480-data-visualization/com-480-project-xiaozu/tree/milestone-1/src/crawling) has requested around 7 hours for a total of 6995 excel files. The crawler was composed by a javascript code to retrieve all the course identifiers (e.g., ww_x_MAT=2032682720) to construct our query and a python part to download the files. We have been able to crawl all the bachelor and master courses offered by EPFL from 2012 until now. 

#### 2.1.2 Pre-processing [TO BE UPDATED]
A challenging task was to clean the data crawled and to select the ones we are interested in. Firstly, the files contained special characters (accents), reason why, we have chosen the Latin encoding. Moreover, data is saved in excel files, which actually contain HTML code. __However, after having parsed, the files are consistent with each other.(updated this part --> it seems they are not consistent!) and add part about pre-processing__
We are more interested in master courses since they are more customizable from the student than Bachelor ones (almost all are mandatory). 

#### 2.1.3 Database generated [TODO]
We have decided to store our data in 4 tables: Student, Enrollment, Course, Teaching.
TODO: make a table in markdown with name of columns or examples (e.g. screenshot from jupyter notebook).

### 2.2 Problematic
#### 2.2.1 Target audience
We expect that the end-users who will use our project will be mainly EPFL students but also companies may be interested in the tool. Users can browse and look at different courses taught by EPFL in the years from 2012 to 2020. 

#### 2.2.2 Visualization purposes
- **#Enrollments per course**:  We want to focus on the number of students enrolled in a course over the years to identify the courses which are becoming more popular (e.g., Machine Learning is nowadays a trendy topic, are the number of students enrolled in that course increased respect 2 years ago?).

- **Help the students to choose their courses**: We want to offer a tool to help students make more versed choices during the course registration by offering targeted visualizations. For example, if student "a" did courses "x", "y" and "z" like student "b" it is very likely that the two have similar interests. Then student "b" might see which other courses have been taken by student "a" to help him/her make an initial skimming of the subjects to follow in the semester. More advanced recommendation system algorithms can be experimented.

- **Find your perfect candidate**: Companies can filter applicants by looking to target students who have taken specific courses. 

- **General data representations**: Some examples: a) we could show a graph to show the trend in the number of students over the years (as explained above); b) indicate the number of students who had re-taken an exam. Moreover, other general visualizations would be to show how many new classes have been added in the year "x" or how many have been removed.

### 2.3 Exploratory Data Analysis
The data anlysis contains three parts. We build the tables contains the figures for our objectives and show some examples in Pre-analysis.ipynb in order to get a hint.
- a) Show the changes of the course enrollment over the years, i.e, for each course, compare the number of students in different years in order to show the popuarity trend of each course. 
- b) Compare the student major(section) composition of each courses. We can get statistic of major intake for each course and then show the different compositions of different courses.
- c) Analyze the similarity of course through the student enrollment based on the the hypothesis that the courses chosen by the same student have some commons. We build the coconrrence matrix of each course and find it is almost consistent with what we expected.

### 2.4 Related work
At the moment, we have not found any other related applications or websites. EPFL students choose courses based on the study plan offered online and keywords that are on the course description pages. As for the feature related to companies, LinkedIn allows HR to find people with specific skills but not for courses that they have done.


##### Some sketches of our future visualizations [TODO: I am updating it]
Show courses related to a selected one and insights about it.
<p align="center">
 <img src="/src/images/sketch1.jpg" width="400px" />
</p>
quando clicchi selezioni, ci saranno troppi corsi. Magari creare profilo e dire che corsi mi sono piaciuti (non scegliere sezione) --> trovare un modo per filtrare

Show the top N courses for a section (e.g. IC) over the years.
<p align="center">
 <img src="/src/images/sketch2.jpg" width="300px" />
</p>


Show relation between a major and the courses selected by its students. For 1 course how people are distributed between different majors. 
<p align="center">
 <img src="/src/images/sketch4.jpg" width="350px" />
</p>
redo or change it --> not for every majors
right: list of popular course
left: master semester
on which semester a course was taken
plot: 1 to 1 relationship or 1 to N


Help a user to choose his/her next semester courses.

remove courses without no connections (maybe change visualization)
