### 2.1 Dataset

Our dataset has been generated by crawling is-academia. The crawling process has requested around 7 hours for a total of 6995 excel files. The crawler was hand-made, and it consisted of retrieving all the course identifiers (e.g., ww_x_MAT=2032682720) to construct our query. We have been able to crawl all the bachelor and master courses offered by EPFL from 2012 until now. A challenging task was to clean the data crawled and selected which ones we were interested in. Firstly, the files contained special characters (accents), reason why, we have chosen the Latin encoding. Moreover, data look like excel files, but they contain HTML code inside. To parse them, we have handled with table and inner tables. However, after having parsed, the files are consistent with each other.
